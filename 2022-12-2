New chapter of life.

I am nearly at the halfway point of my chemotherapy! That means it is time to start actually taking my plans seriously and build on top of what I have learned over this time period.

I learned a lot about how my mind and body work. I have done my fair share of reflections and insights—leading to a deeper understanding of myself than ever before. But now, it is time to use that knowledge for future: learn how to build my new habits and actually become a better person.

## Plan for the rest of the chemotime
- Finish *Phenomenology of Spirit*
- Finish with *A Thousand Plateaus*
- Finish *The Accursed Share*
- Finish two Žižek's books
Maybe also some Kant, but I don't think so haha...

## Plan for the rest of this week:
- Finish A. Consciousness
- Catch up on *The Accursed Share*
- Read *ATP*
